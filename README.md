# **Balanced Binary Search Trees**
 
Implementation of some popular Balanced Binary Search Trees and Benchmark Comparison

# **Implementation**

- ## [`AVL Tree`](AdelsonVelskyLandisTree.cpp)
- ## [`Red Black Tree`](RedBlackTree.cpp)
- ## [`Splay Tree`](Splay%20Tree.cpp)
- ## [`Treap`](Treap.cpp)

# **Benchmark Comparison**

RBT is surprisingly fastest despite its recursive implementation . Treap is slowest as expected with its high constant factor .
